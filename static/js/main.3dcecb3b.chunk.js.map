My suggestion is that you join me on my walks and we chat in English the whole day. I would discreetly correct your mistakes, suggest new ways of saying something and provide a lot of  colloquial vocabulary input. Walks would be easy-medium difficulty, involving 3-5 hours walking and 300-600 metres of difference in altitude. We would meet in the morning for a coffee, go by bus/train (using public transport as much as possible), chatting in English, then set out on our walk, have a picnic in a beautiful spot, walk down and return, perhaps stopping for an ice-cream or a beer.
